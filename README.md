# Madlibs

**Author**: Terrell Douglas
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
As a user I think it would be fun to run a file with customizable templates that I could run in terminal. On those templates I want different MadLib short stories. I want to see a greeting in the beginning and a thank you in the end. As a user I would also want the center of the template to tell me how many questions are in that template, and i want it to display my story once I am done.

## Getting Started
First you must write a read function and a write function. Then write a function that would  replace all of the curley braces and their contents with empth curley braces. Read the txt file that you have made with your template on it. Go through the template and take all of the values in curley braces and insert them into that function and replace everything with an empty obj. For example: .replace("{Verb}", "{}")
Then make a functon that would take those empty objs and assign each one a different value. That value will then need to be given a variable that is paired with the variable assigned to the user input of that item.
